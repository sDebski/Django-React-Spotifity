# Django-React-Spotifity

This is a Spotifity App written in *Django* and *React* with *Django Rest Framework* based on connection to *Spotify API*.
This app is made to create rooms when people can listen to music together.
Rooms are based on host's Spotify account connection. 
Users can skip songs or play/pause them.
Host can modify room properties to allow or disallow guests to manage songs.


## App supports:
- getting data from REST API endpoints
- live connection to Spotify API based on room's host account
- Creating Roooms
- Joining or leaving rooms
- Managing room properties by host
- Voting to skip the song (as guest)
- Playing or pausing songs (for guests if allowed by host)
- Displaying current song that is played on room's host account
